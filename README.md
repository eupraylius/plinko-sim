Plinko Sim is a physics-based arcade simulation built in C using the Raylib graphics library.

The project simulates a classic Plinko-style game with:
- Real-time gravity and motion
- Peg collision physics
- Scoring buckets
- Start menu and replay system
- Modular multi-file architecture

## Tech Stack
- Language: C
- Graphics: Raylib
- Build: CMake
- IDE: CLion

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in CLion
3. Build and run the project
4. Keep the `assets/` folder in the root directory

## Future Plans
- Custom sprites and assets
- Sound effects
- Multiple levels
- UI polish

Built as a learning project to explore game physics and simulation in C.
